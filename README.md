# Kotekan

Back to basics.

Major dependencies:
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) (via Bun)

Goals
- As simple as possible
- As few dependencies as possible

Ideas
- react-strict-dom?


Anti-goals/indicators that things are going into the wrong direction:
- Bundling via esbuild or other tools
- Non-ESM
- Transpiling to JS
- No legacy
