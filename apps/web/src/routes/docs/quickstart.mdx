# Quickstart

To get started with Kotekan, create a new project by running:

**bun create kotekan**

Then start up the dev server by running:

**bun dev**

This documentation website is built with Kotekan, and I'm also working to add some more documentation to help people try it out. You can find the project at [github.com/bndkt/kotekan](https://github.com/bndkt/kotekan)
